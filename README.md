# Obsidian-Vault-Template-Fork v1.1.2
## A Template For My Obsidian Vault Based Off Of CyanVoxel's.

This is a copy of my Obsidian Vault, that you can use as a template or inspiration for your vault.
This repository serves as a modified version of CyanVoxel's vault seen in their [Vault Tour](https://youtu.be/rAkerV8rlow) video, which you can watch for a full rundown of the appearance and plugins used in this vault.

This vault contains several of my other snippets, which you can find in their own (and updated) repositories here:
- [Colored Sidebar](https://github.com/CyanVoxel/Obsidian-Colored-Sidebar)
- [Daily Themes Fork](https://github.com/CodyEdition/Obsidian-Daily-Themes-Fork)
- [Notebook Themes](https://github.com/CyanVoxel/Obsidian-Notebook-Themes)
- [Game Themes](https://github.com/CyanVoxel/Obsidian-Game-Themes)

***NOTICE:** I'll try to update this repository as I develop my style and methods, but I recommend you build your vault from the default configurations while discovering and changing settings as you go. Please check the repositories listed above as well as the plugins inside the vault to have an up-to-date experience.*
